      question: "Why aren't you buying goods from customers?",
      answer:
        "Once I bought aluminum at a very cheap price, then Galactic Police officers came to me and confiscated all the goods that were supposedly stolen. They said it's been a common situation lately and they are on the trail of a gang that is distributing stolen goods around the galaxy. So far, I have not recovered neither the credits nor the goods, so just in case I have suspended the buying.",

        "Many rockets land here, our planet is a popular tourist attraction. But yeah... I heard that a rocket landed very precisely and slowly recently, but no one has come out of it since then. As you have probably noticed, the inhabitants of the planet are children, and they immediately run to see what lands here.",

Rare parts are provided by mercenaries who hunt UFOs - these ships are a real treasure. I am waiting for the day when we manage to take over some large ship and we can obtain some alien technology.
