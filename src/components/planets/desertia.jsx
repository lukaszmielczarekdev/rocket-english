There are many temples and other religious buildings that are tourist attractions, for example the huge Helios Bazaar, where you can buy items and souvenirs with the image of the sun god.";

In the south of the planet, the temperature is very high, reaching even 80 Â° C, the rest of the planet lies in the temperate zone, which makes up about 80% of the planet's surface. It never rains in the desert, while in the rest of the area, rainfall is commonplace, hence the lush vegetation surrounding the capital.";
